# Day 09 — Java bootcamp
### Sockets

*Takeaways: Today you will implement the basic mechanism of a client/server application based on Java—Sockets API.*

# Exercise 00 — Registration

Exercise 00: Registration ||
---|---
Turn-in directory	| ex00
Files to turn-in |	Chat-folder

Before you start creating a full-scale multi-user chat, you need to implement the core functionality and build the basic architecture of the system.

Now you need to create two applications: a socket server and a socket client. The server will support connecting to a single client and will be created as a separate Maven project. The server JAR file is started as follows:
```
$ java -jar target/socket-server.jar --port=8081
```

Client is also a separate project:
```
$ java -jar target/socket-client.jar --server-port=8081
```

In this task, you need to implement the registration functionality. Example of the client operation:
```
Hello from Server!
> signUp
Enter username:
> Marsel
Enter password:
> qwerty007
Successful!
```

The connection must be closed after the Successful! message is displayed.

To ensure secure storage of passwords, use a hashing mechanism with PasswordEncoder and BCryptPasswordEncoder (see Spring Security components). The container for this component is described in a class of the SocketsApplicationConfig configuration and used in the UsersService.

Key client/server interaction logic and the use of UsersService via Spring Context must be implemented in the Server class.

**Additional Requirements**:
- Use a single DataSource — HikariCP.
- Repository operation must be implemented via JdbcTemplate.
- Services, repositories, utility classes must be context bins.

Server application architecture (client application is at the discretion of the developer):

- Chat
    - SocketServer
        - src
            - main
                - java
                    - edu.school21.sockets
                        - server
                            -	Server
                        - models
                            -	User
                        - services
                            - UsersService
                            - UsersServiceImpl
                        - repositories
                            - CrudRepository
                            - UsersRepository
                            - UsersRepositoryImpl
                        - app
                            - Main
                        - config
                            - SocketsApplicationConfig
                - resources
                    - db.properties
        - pom.xml


# Exercise 01 – Messaging

Exercise 01: Messaging ||
---|---
Turn-in directory |	ex01
Files to turn-in |	Chat-folder

Once you have implemented the application backbone, you should provide multi-user messaging.

You need to modify the application to support the following chat user lifecycle:
1. Registration;
2. Sign in (if no user is detected, close a connection);
3. Send messages (each user connected to the server must receive a message);
4. Log off.

Example of how the application works on the client side:
```
Hello from Server!
> signIn
Enter username:
> Marsel
Enter password:
> qwerty007
Start messaging
> Hello!
Marsel: Hello!
NotMarsel: Bye!
> Exit
You have left the chat.
```
Each message is stored in the database and contains the following information:
- Sender;
- Message text;
- Sending time.

**Note**:
- For comprehensive testing, run multiple jar files of the client application.


# Exercise 02 — Rooms

Exercise 02: Rooms ||
---|---
Turn-in directory |	ex02
Files to turn-in |	Chat-folder

To make our application fully functional, let's add the concept of "chatrooms". Each chatroom can have a certain number of users. The chatroom contains a set of messages from participating users.

Each user can:
1.	Create a chatroom;
2.	Select a chatroom;
3.	Send a message to a chatroom;
4.	Leave a chatroom.

When the user re-enters the application, the last 30 messages are displayed in the room the user previously visited.

Example of how the application works on the client side:
```
Hello from Server!
1. signIn
2. SignUp
3. Exit
> 1
Enter username:
> Marsel
Enter password:
> qwerty007
1.	Create room
2.	Choose room
3.	Exit
> 2
Rooms:
1. First Room
2. SimpleRoom
3. JavaRoom
4. Exit
> 3
Java Room ---
JavaMan: Hello!
> Hello!
Marsel: Hello!
> Exit
You have left the chat.
```

Using the JSON format for message exchange will be a special task for you. For example, each user command or message must be sent to (and received from) the server in the form of a JSON line.

For example, a command to send a message might look like this (the specific content of the messages is at the developer's discretion):
```JSON
{
  "message" : "Hello!",
  "fromId" : 4,
  "roomId": 10
}
```
